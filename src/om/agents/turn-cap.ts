/**
 * Cross-generation turn cap for the OM agent loops.
 *
 * Pi <= 0.86 caps a run with `shouldStopAfterTurn`, a boolean predicate called
 * after each completed turn; returning truthy ends the run. Pi 0.87 removed that
 * option in favour of `finishTurn`, which ends the run by returning
 * `{ action: "end" }`. A host ignores the option it does not know, so the cap
 * emits both and lets the loaded Pi generation pick its own: emitting only
 * `shouldStopAfterTurn` silently dropped the `agentMaxTurns` budget on 0.87,
 * where workers ran until they stopped naturally, errored, or were aborted.
 *
 * Each hook counts separately, so a host that calls both still ends the run after
 * `maxTurns` turns instead of half of them. A turn that already hard-exited
 * (`error` or `aborted`) is never a decision and never spends budget: the loop
 * aborts those runs itself, and the cap only governs completed turns.
 *
 * See https://github.com/elpapi42/pi-observational-memory/pull/83.
